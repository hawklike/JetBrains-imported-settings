## Clion
Clion exported settings. Syntax colour is as much as possible similar to Atom highlighting. Includes live templates of boost library, SFML, compiler flags. If you type file, code which enables to read input from a file is generated. Another option is to write down sync_stdio_off, which as the text says, switches off synchronisation with stdio buffers.
